# Revisions

## 1.0.0

- Initial release

We need to update the following texts:
- update "dependent" to "dependant" ✅ (front-facing text only)
- update "dependents" to "dependants" ✅ (front-facing text only)

- There should only be financial membership type at registration page. A non-financial member can only be added by the financial member. So let's remove the non-financial membership type from the registration page.

- The admin should be able to create communities, then people register into that community.

- It's not just a membership site, it's a SAAS community app, so we should be able to create a community then onboard people into it. The admin should be able to manage different communities on the platform.

- Member groups of a community should not be able to see other community. 
- The app name should be dynamic based on the community name.
- The app logo should be dynamic based on the community name.
- The app favicon should be dynamic based on the community name.

- Createa template for us to manage and create communities.


Meeting Time:
[5/5/2025 9:36 PM] Mr Kolawole JA: Hello Emma,
I was able to create my account and login with same. However, does it mean that everyone that creates account and logs in belong to the same tribe/clan? There is need to separate users based on groups/clan adopted at point of sign-on. With what we have here, it looks like it's only one clan for all users.
[5/5/2025 9:46 PM] Techifice: Yes sir, there's only one now because there's no clan division right now.

It's part of the improvement we are cycling in this current stage after our Saturday meeting.

If you remember sir, I asked during our last meeting that the person who uses the registration page should be a Clan leader. If the registrant is a financial member, how will he know the community he belongs? Will he select from options of available community?

The response was that we create a backdoor, invite-only link that will be shared with the community admin to set up his clan.
[5/5/2025 9:47 PM] Techifice: Then the community admin can share links for his people to register into his clan.
[5/5/2025 10:18 PM] Eng. Okafor (Can): When are these segregations expected to be ready for testing?
[5/5/2025 10:19 PM] Eng. Okafor (Can): Meanwhile I haven't been able to test beyond the date of birth input.
[5/7/2025 4:02 AM] Eng. Okafor (Can): Emma, whenever I press "set" after entering the date of birth it ends in error. What could be the problem?

And it seems to happen only when entering Financial members records.

Also we should provide a button to enable a member to view a log of his record and those of dependants - like he's the "admin" of his family.

The button to press to save the record should read "save record" or "save dependant"

When users log in they should see the name of their community picked from the control record, eg:

* NNEWI COMMUNITY IN THE US
* ILE-IFE COMMUNITY IN CANADA 
* etc.

If the name of our software must be displayed, it should show as a small print on top (or at the bottom) of the screen.
[5/7/2025 9:42 AM] Techifice: Okay sir,
I'll push an update that will correct that in production
