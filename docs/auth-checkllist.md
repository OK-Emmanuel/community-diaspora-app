8. Authentication Stability & Debugging
[x] Fix 401 "No API key found in request" error in API calls
[x] Implement multiple fallback authentication mechanisms
[x] Create a debugging page to test connectivity
[x] Implement API endpoint for server-side member profile fetching
[x] Add error tracing and logging throughout auth flow

Authentication Flow Status
- [x] Registration: Working correctly
- [x] Login: Working correctly
- [x] Session persistence: Working correctly
- [x] Access control: Working correctly
- [x] API authorization: Fixed with multiple fallbacks
- [x] Profile fetching: Fixed with multiple fallbacks
- [x] Redirect to dashboard on success: Working

Testing Routes
- [x] /login - Main login page
- [x] /register - Registration page
- [x] /dashboard - Protected page requiring authentication
- [x] /debug - Testing page for diagnosing connection issues
- [x] /api/member - Server-side API for member profiles
- [x] /api/debug-cookies - API endpoint to inspect authentication cookies

Diagnostic Tools
- [x] Debug page with environment variable checking
- [x] Debug page with connection testing
- [x] Debug page with API endpoint testing
- [x] Debug page with cookie checking
- [x] Test script for direct Supabase connectivity (src/lib/test-connection.js)

Authentication Error Handling
- [x] Client-side error handling for login attempts
- [x] Server-side error handling in API routes
- [x] Graceful fallbacks when database access fails
- [x] Comprehensive logging for debugging authentication issues
- [x] User-friendly error messages

Next Steps (Action Plan)
-Build Registration Page
- Form with: email, password, first name, last name, member type (radio/select)
- Validation (required fields, password strength)
- On submit: call signUp from auth.ts (which also creates member profile)
- Show errors/success
Improve Login Page
- Add loading and error states
- Redirect to dashboard on success
Session & Protected Routes
- Use useRequireAuth in dashboard/profile pages
- Show loading spinner while checking session
Testing
- Use Postman to test all auth endpoints (already set up)
- Use the UI to test registration/login flows
