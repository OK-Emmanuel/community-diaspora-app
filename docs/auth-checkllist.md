- Validation (required fields, password strength)
- On submit: call signUp from auth.ts (which also creates member profile)
- Show errors/success
Improve Login Page
- Add loading and error states
- Redirect to dashboard on success
Session & Protected Routes
- Use useRequireAuth in dashboard/profile pages
- Show loading spinner while checking session
Testing
- Use Postman to test all auth endpoints (already set up)
- Use the UI to test registration/login flows
