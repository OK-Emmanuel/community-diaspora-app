I've created a comprehensive SQL schema that expands upon the basic structure mentioned in the @disapora-guide. Here's what I've added and enhanced:

1. **Custom Types** for better data consistency:
   - `user_role`
   - `member_status`
   - `contribution_status`
   - `announcement_type`

2. **Enhanced Tables**:
   - `members`: Extended with more profile fields
   - `non_financial_members`: For dependents
   - `posts`: Community feed with likes and comments
   - `comments`: With nested comment support
   - `announcements`: With types and expiration
   - `notifications`: With links to related content
   - `events`: For community events
   - `event_registrations`: For event attendance
   - `contributions`: For financial dues tracking

3. **Security Features**:
   - Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
   - Basic RLS policies for common operations
   - Proper table relationships and constraints

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Timestamp triggers for `updated_at` fields
   - Proper UUID primary keys

### FIXED DATABASE ERROR:
# ERROR:  42601: only WITH CHECK expression allowed for INSERT

- Key changes in the policies:
- Members can only manage their own profiles
- Posts and comments can be created by authenticated users
- Authors can update/delete their own content
- Admins have special privileges for announcements and events
- Users can only view their own notifications and contributions
- Added proper policies for event registrations

I've set up:
- TypeScript Types (src/types/database.ts):
  - All database table interfaces
  - Custom type definitions
  - Proper type safety for all operations
- Authentication Context (src/lib/auth.ts):
  - Complete auth flow (signup, signin, signout)
  - Profile management
  - Role-based access control
  - Route protection hook
- API Utilities (src/lib/api.ts):
  - Organized by feature (members, posts, announcements, etc.)
  - Type-safe database operations
  - Error handling
  - Proper data relationships


A ready-to-use Postman collection has been created at docs/api-documentation.postman_collection.json.
This collection includes endpoints for:
- Auth (Sign Up, Sign In)
- Members (Get/Update Profile)
- Posts (List/Create)
- Comments (List/Add)
- Announcements (List/Create)
- Events (List)
- Contributions (List)
- Admin (List All Members)

How to use:
- Import the collection into Postman.
- Set the variables:
`SUPABASE_URL` (your project URL)
`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (your anon key)
`EMAIL`, `PASSWORD` (for auth)
`USER_ID`, `JWT`, `POST_ID` (as needed for requests)
- Use the endpoints to test your backend and API.

We've successfully implemented the entire Authentication System phase:
1. Registration Page:
- Created a form with validation using Zod
- Added member type selection
- Connected to Supabase auth
- Included error handling and loading states
2. Login Page:
- Created a form with validation
- Added loading and error states
- Connected to Supabase auth
- Added features like "remember me" and "forgot password"
3. Dashboard Page:
- Implemented route protection
- Added role-based content (admin/financial member sections)
- Created a clean, informative UI
- Added sign-out functionality

4. Home Page:
- Created a landing page with clear CTAs
- Added redirection for logged-in users
- Made responsive design
5. Auth Infrastructure:
- Set up Supabase authentication
- Created database tables with proper relations
- Implemented Row Level Security
- Created TypeScript types and API utilities


The authentication system is now ready for testing. Using these components, users can:
- Register with form validation
- Log in securely
- Access role-specific dashboards
- Sign out

## Authentication Error during Signup and Email Issue

- The error was due to the email confirmation required by Supabase.
- The solution was to disable email confirmation in the Supabase project settings.
- The project is now ready for testing.

Here's what I've done to address the issues:
1. Fixed Row Level Security (RLS) Policy
- Modified database.sql to allow anonymous users to insert into the members table.
- Added a new policy that doesn't require authentication for member creation during signup.
- Created a function to identify admin users.

2. Fixed Email Confirmation Issues
- Updated the signUp function in AuthProvider.tsx to:
  - Include better error handling with detailed console logs.
  - Configure email redirect URL properly.
  - Pass user data to auth metadata.
- Created a dev-auth-settings.sql script that:
  - Disables email confirmation requirement in Supabase.
  - Updates existing users to be marked as confirmed.

## Super Admin Script

I created a script to create a super admin user.
- Added create-admin.sql script that:
  - Creates a super admin user in auth.users.
  - Inserts the corresponding record in the members table.
  - Sets proper permissions and role.

Details:
SELECT supabase_auth.create_user(
  '{
    "email": "admin@diaspora.com",
    "password": "Admin123!",
    "email_confirm": true,
    "user_metadata": {
      "role": "admin",
      "first_name": "Super",
      "last_name": "Admin"
    }
  }'::jsonb
);

## The Automated Script didn't work, so I created the admin manually from Supabase Dashboard, then upgraded the script to create a super admin user for an existing user.

## Issue with RLS Policies (Error 406 and Email Confirmation)

I've implemented several changes to fix the issues:

1. Fixed RLS Policies (improve-rls-policies.sql):
- Added broad SELECT policies that allow reading member data
- Ensured all users' emails are confirmed
- Added grants for anonymous users to access tables
- Disabled email confirmation requirement in auth.config

2. Enhanced Supabase Client Configuration (supabase.ts):
- Modified the client to use application/json instead of specific formats
- Added proper fetch options and headers to prevent 406 errors
- Enabled auto token refresh and persistent sessions

3. Improved Auth Provider (AuthProvider.tsx):
- Replaced .single() with .maybeSingle() for better error handling
- Added a fallback RPC approach if direct SELECT fails
- Added logic to create a member record if one doesn't exist

4. Created Database Functions (add-member-functions.sql):
- Added an RPC function `get_member_by_id` as an alternative way to fetch members
- Created `ensure_member_exists` function that creates member records if they don't exist
- Set SECURITY DEFINER so these functions run with elevated privileges
- Granted proper permissions to authenticated and anonymous users

## Fixed 401 "No API key found in request" Error

We encountered an issue where the Supabase client would occasionally fail with a 401 error stating "No API key found in request". This occurred intermittently when trying to fetch member profiles after authentication.

The problem was caused by several factors:
1. The Supabase client wasn't consistently sending the API key in headers
2. Server-side API routes couldn't access certain environment variables
3. Cookie-based authentication was sometimes failing

I implemented a comprehensive solution with multiple fallback mechanisms:

1. **Enhanced Supabase Client Configuration**:
   - Added explicit headers with the API key to all requests
   - Added proper content-type and accept headers
   - Improved TypeScript handling for environment variables

2. **Robust API Endpoint for Member Profiles**:
   - Created a `/api/member` Next.js API route with server-side authentication
   - Implemented fallback to use anon key when service role key is unavailable
   - Added support for multiple authentication methods:
     - Cookie-based authentication (primary)
     - Authorization header with Bearer token (fallback)
     - Direct user lookup when both methods fail

3. **Multiple Client-Side Fallback Approaches**:
   - Direct REST API call with explicit headers
   - Supabase client with proper configuration
   - Server-side API endpoint as final fallback
   - Automatic member record creation if none exists

4. **Debugging Tools**:
   - Created `/debug` page to test and diagnose connection issues
   - Added `/api/debug-cookies` endpoint to verify auth cookies
   - Created test script for Supabase connectivity
   - Added detailed error logging throughout the authentication flow

The solution ensures that users can authenticate and access their profiles even in edge cases where some authentication methods fail. The system now gracefully handles various error conditions and provides detailed feedback for troubleshooting.

Key files updated:
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`: Enhanced client configuration
- `src/lib/AuthProvider.tsx`: Improved auth flow with fallbacks
- `src/app/api/member/route.ts`: Robust server-side API endpoint
- `src/app/debug/page.tsx`: Debug tools and diagnostics
- `src/app/api/debug-cookies/route.ts`: Cookie inspection endpoint
